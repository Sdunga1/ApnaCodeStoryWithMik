# Old Vite Files - Safe to Delete After Verification

These files are from the old Vite setup and are no longer needed:

## Configuration Files
- vite.config.ts (replaced by next.config.js)
- index.html (Next.js doesn't need this)

## Entry Points
- src/main.tsx (replaced by src/app/layout.tsx and src/app/page.tsx)
- src/App.tsx (moved logic to src/app/page.tsx)

## Type Definitions
- src/vite-env.d.ts (replaced by next-env.d.ts)

## Assets (already copied to public/)
- src/assets/pic.jpg (now in public/pic.jpg)

## Recommendation:
DO NOT DELETE THESE YET! First verify that the Next.js version works correctly:

1. Run: npm install
2. Run: npm run dev
3. Test all functionality
4. Once confirmed working, you can safely delete these files

## Delete Command (Run only after verification):
```bash
# From the frontend/ directory
rm vite.config.ts
rm index.html
rm src/main.tsx
rm src/App.tsx
rm src/vite-env.d.ts
rm -rf src/assets/
```
